# deequ-documentation-for-data-exploration
After attempting to build scala scripts employing deequ tools, it appeared that some documentation would be beneficial.
This project is in no way affiliated with AWS or deequ, it is entirely to be helpful for those who appreciate documentation. 

---
Goals of this documentation
- create templates for building deequ verification and analysis scripts to expedite general EDA workflows
---

## Build a test environment for documenting this 
 - [ ] Document scala version
 - [ ] Document sbt version
 - [ ] Document java version
 - [ ] Document spark version
 - [ ] Create general structure & functionality for multi column repitions of deequ applications
 - [ ] Create multitype test suite of dataframes

## Adding Analyzers To VerificationSuite Reports
... How exactly do you do this (concisely and properly)? 

## Handling Empty Strings As ```nulls```
Shouldn't this be callable when assessing Completeness?
